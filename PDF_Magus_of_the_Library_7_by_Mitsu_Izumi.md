Overview
A story about a poor boy swept away by a kind library mage and the (literal) magic of reading, Magus of the Library is a beautifully-drawn, spirited fantasy adventure, like a Fullmetal Alchemist for all ages!
 
 
 Ages 13 and up.
 
 In the small village of Amun lives a poor boy named Theo. Theo adores books, but because of his pointed ears and impoverished life, he isn&#039;t allowed to use the village library. As he endures the prejudice and hatred of the village, he dreams of going where such things don&#039;t exist: Aftzaak, City of Books. But one day, Theo chances to meet a Kafnaâ€”a librarian who works for the great library of Aftzaakâ€”and his life changes forever...
