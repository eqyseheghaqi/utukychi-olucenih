Overview
Get ready for mayhem and pigeon poo in the latest instalment in the Game On series, a fast-paced adventure featuring rogue technology, warring siblings, and disasters of CAT-ASTROPHIC proportions. Maxs summer holidays are going decidedly NOT to plan. Its bad enough he has to deal with his infuriating younger brother Liam, but now his mums new boyfriend is always around, along with his EVIL son Josh. It seems like things cant possibly get any worse Then Miss McBoobs phone strikes again, an app transforms Max and Liam from human boys into fleas, and everything goes downhill from there. The brothers are forced to work together to try to beat the app as it serves up impossible questions. Would they rather climb trees like a squirrel or breathe under water like a goldfish? And which option will help them survive until the next round? Chaos ensues as the reluctant sidekicks race to return to human form before time runs out. Full of awesome facts, laugh out loud situations and comic-style illustrations that bring the action to life, this gaming-inspired adventure is perfect for reluctant readers.
