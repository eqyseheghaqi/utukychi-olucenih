Overview
The Broken Whistle is a searing exposÃ© that unveils a chilling chapter in American history, a narrative meticulously recounted by Pedro Israel Orta. Plunged into the heart of power and deception, Orta emerges as a force to be reckoned with. On September 23, 2019, his single Twitter thread ignited a tempest, tearing through the sinister underbelly of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA), which had been perverted for political ends. In this gripping account, Orta fearlessly shines a light on a corrupt system that brazenly weaponized the very process designed to uphold truth and accountability. As the pages unfold, Orta unflinchingly reveals how the Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblowing process was perverted to target a sitting president, while genuine whistleblowers endured unimaginable torment and abandonment. With chilling detail and unyielding determination, Orta pulls back the curtain on the U.S. National Security Bureaucratic State, exposing the rampant abuse of power by the Deep State, shielded by Congress&#039;s deafening silence. Delving deep into the heart of darkness, Orta uncovers the unsettling saga triggered by the enigmatic &quot;Ukraine whistleblower,&quot; whose disclosures unleashed a political storm, despite falling outside the jurisdiction of ICIG and DNI, as confirmed by the Department of Justice. These allegations, detached from intelligence activities, were shamelessly exploited-an elaborate ruse orchestrated to manipulate public opinion and orchestrate the impeachment of a president. Through the pages of The Broken Whistle, Orta lays bare his own harrowing journey, navigating the treacherous corridors of the Central Intelligence Agency. Within these walls, truth becomes an enemy, and those who dare to speak out face ruthless retribution and termination. As Orta&#039;s unwavering voice rises above the cacophony of corruption, readers are led on an odyssey that unveils a bureaucratic machine bent on crushing dissent and preserving its shadowy secrets. The Broken Whistle is an unapologetic chronicle of one man&#039;s fight for justice-a clarion call that reverberates through the darkest corners of power. Prepare to be captivated by Orta&#039;s unflinching courage as he peels back the layers of deception, exposing a broken system that has forsaken its sacred duty.
