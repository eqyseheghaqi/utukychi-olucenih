A bond this strong canâ€™t stay broken.

 Life near the army base at Fort Benning, Georgia, might be small, but itâ€™s safe. That suits Karina Fischer just fine. She knows letting anyone get close to her means she could get hurt, and sheâ€™s had enough of that in her almost twenty-one years to last a lifetime. The only man sheâ€™s ever let in, Kael Martin, betrayed her trust before they could find their way together. She canâ€™t forgive him for what heâ€™s done, but letting go still feels impossible.

 Kael Martinâ€™s scars run deep, but the mark Karina left on him is deeper. He canâ€™t get her out of his mind or his heart. Heâ€™s ready to start fresh, adjust to civilian life, and build a future outside of the Armyâ€”one he hopes could include Karina, because their spark, while it burned, was unforgettable.

 Now, just when it seems their world is crumbling and canâ€™t be put back together, circumstances force them to confront what they canâ€™t deny: the volatile, passionate, all-consuming love they canâ€™t live without.

Karina and Kael&amp;#039;s unlikely love story, which began in THE FALLING, grows deeper and even more intense in THE BURNING, the second book in the Brightest Stars trilogy.
